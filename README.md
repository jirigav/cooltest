# CoolTest

CoolTest is a randomness-testing tool. It uses first half of provided data to construct a distinguisher based on a histogram construction. Then it evaluates the distinguisher on the second half of the data to evaluate the probability of the data being generated by true random number generator.

This tool is based on our paper published at [IFIP SEC 2025](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-92886-4_1).
